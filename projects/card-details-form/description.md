### Requirements

Your challenge is to build out this interactive card details form and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

<p align="center">
<img width="80%" src="./assets/desktop-design.jpg">
<img width="80%" src="./assets/active-states.jpg">

  - The card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page
- Store, access and edit saved cards

### What you will learn

- Start a React project from scratch
- Get familiar with Chain Services
- Understand and be able to use utility functions: `setPath`, `getPath`, `cascadeFind`, `cascadeChange`, `scope`, ...
- CSS/SCSS good practices
- Responsive design
